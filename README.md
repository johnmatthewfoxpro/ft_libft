# ft_libft
My updated and more complete version of LIBTFT.

## __DESCRIPTION__
My first libary and an introduction to makefiles.
This library includes the initial 34 functions of LIBFT with the relevent header file and makefile.
However, version 2.0.0 also includes my ft\_printf function and get\_next_line function, making this release more complete.
The makefile has also been improved to better reflect my current level and understanding of such files.

Not that the bonus has not yet been completed.

## __INSTRUCTIONS__
Use 'make' in the command line to create the library.
After that, functions in this library can be included in any project by calling them as normal.
Note that when compiling the library must be included.
Example: "cc main.c -Wextra -Werror -Wall libft.a"

## __RESOURCES__
AI was not used in this project.

My first School 42 project. LIBTFT.

## __DESCRIPTION__
My first libary and an introduction to makefiles.
This library includes 34 functions with the relevent header file and makefile.

The bonus was not completed.

## __INSTRUCTIONS__
Use 'make' in the command line to create the library.
After that, functions in this library can be included in any project by calling them as normal.
Note that when compiling the library must be included.
Example: "cc main.c -Wextra -Werror -Wall libft.a"

## __RESOURCES__
AI was not used in this project.
